# Exploratory-data-Analysis-(EDA)-with-Pandas-in-Banking

1. Explore a banking dataset with Pandas framework.
2. Build pivot tables.
3. Visualize the dataset with various plot types.

The data that we are going to use for this is a subset of an open source Bank Marketing Data Set from the UCI ML repository: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/citation_policy.html.

This dataset is publicly available for research. The details are described in [Moro et al., 2014]. Please include this citation if you plan to use this database: [Moro et al., 2014] S. Moro, P. Cortez and P. Rita. A Data-Driven Approach to Predict the Success of Bank Telemarketing. Decision Support Systems, Elsevier, 62:22-31, June 2014

During the work, the task of preliminary analysis of a positive response (term deposit) to direct calls from a bank is solved. In essence, the task is a matter of bank scoring, i.e. according to the characteristics of a client (potential client), their behavior is predicted (loan default, a wish to make a deposit, etc.).

* In this Project, we will try to give answers to a set of questions that may be relevant when analyzing banking data:

1. What is the share of clients attracted in our source data?
2. What are the mean values of numerical features among the attracted clients?
3. What is the average call duration for the attracted clients?
4. What is the average age among the attracted and unmarried clients?
5. What is the average age and call duration for different types of client employment?

In addition, we will make a visual analysis in order to plan marketing banking campaigns more effectively.

Pandas is a Python library that provides extensive means for data analysis. Data scientists often work with data stored in table formats like .csv, .tsv, or .xlsx. Pandas makes it very convenient to load, process, and analyze such tabular data using SQL-like queries. In conjunction with Matplotlib and Seaborn, Pandas provides a wide range of opportunities for visual analysis of tabular data.
